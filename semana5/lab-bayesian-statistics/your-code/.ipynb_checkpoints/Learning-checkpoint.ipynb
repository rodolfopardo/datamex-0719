    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Introduction to Probability lesson, we introduced conditional probability, which is a prerequisite for Bayesian Statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "A conditional probability is a probability based on some background information. It's notation is typically expressed as P(A|B), which means the probability of event A occurring given that some condition B is true. We saw that this could be computed using the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the probability of A given B equals the probability of the intersection of A and B divided by the probability of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also briefly touched on the independence and dependence of events and said that when events are independent, at least one of the following must be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(A)\n",
    "P(B|A) = P(B)\n",
    "P(A∩B) = P(A) P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if the events are truly independent, then the probability of one given another should just be the probability of that event occurring. Similarly, the probability of the intersection of the two events should just be the product of the probabilities of the two events, since neither one impacts the other.\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "For dependent events, we need to modify the last set of equations to account for the fact that one event impacts the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A∩B) = P(A) P(B|A)\n",
    "P(B∩A) = P(B) P(A|B)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the intersection of A and B equals the probability of A times the probability of B given A and, since there is nothing special about A versus B, it also equals the probability of B times the probability of A given B.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is the case, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) P(A|B) = P(A) P(B|A)\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we divide both sides by P(B), we end up with the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(A) P(B|A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is known as Bayes' Theorem, and it is a surprisingly powerful equation that forms the fundamental idea behind all Bayesian statistics. It allows us to establish what we believe about the probability of a hypothesis prior to seeing any data, and it also provides us with a means by which to update those beliefs once we have seen some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation has a few different components, so let's break those down:\n",
    "\n",
    "    P(A) is known as the prior probability, and it is the the probability of the hypothesis before we see the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    P(B|A) is known as the likelihood, and it represents the probability of the data under the hypothesis.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    P(B) is known as the marginal probability, and it is a normalizing constant that represents the probability of the data under any hypothesis, or P(A∪B). In other words, it can be computed as P(A) P(B|A) + P(-A) P(B|-A) where -A is Not A (the alternative scenario of the hypothesis).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    P(A|B) is known as the posterior probability, and it is the probability that we want to compute after having seen the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: It is important to emphasize here that the hypothesis is represented by A and the observed data is represented by B. A common mistake and point of confusion is to think that A and B represent two different hypotheses, which is not the case. The two opposing hypotheses are represented by A and -A.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a function in Python that accepts a list of priors and corresponding likelihoods. Our function will compute the marginal (marg) and then use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities for the each of the hypotheses (post)."

    "Now that we have our function, let's propose a scenario and use our function to help us solve for the posterior probabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we would need to know what our prior probabilities were and our likelihoods. For the priors, we can assume that the probability we drew the marble from any one jar is equally probably, or 1/3. The likelihoods in this case would just be the percentages of green marbles in each jar. We can plug these values into our bayes_rule function, and it will return the following outputs.\n",

    "# Bayesian Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example was a simple one with the objective of demonstrating how Bayes' Theorem works. When doing Bayesian Data Analysis in the real world, the priors and the posteriors are typically probability distributions. We typically have some data, and the way to get from the prior to the posterior is typically a generative model (one that accepts parameters and generates data from them).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense of how this works, let's look at an example. Suppose we have just launched an online store that sells fidget spinners, and we are trying to estimate what percentage of visitors to our online store will make a purchase. We can set this up as a Bayesian problem and arrive at a probability distribution as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to seeing any traffic or purchase data, we have no idea what to expect so we will start with the assumption that all percentages are equally likely. This is called a uniform prior because we can use a uniform distribution to represent the fact that every rate has an equal chance of being the actual rate of purchase. To set this up in Python, we are going to use Numpy to generate a uniform distribution from 100,000 random draws of numbers between 0 and 1.\n",
